This task focuses on analyzing sales data using Excel Pivot Tables to generate meaningful business insights.
The dataset was first cleaned and converted into a structured table to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Multiple pivot tables were created to summarize total sales by category, region, and segment.

Pivot charts and slicers were used to make the analysis interactive and visually clear.
Based on the pivot results, key insights were written to support data-driven decision making.

The final analysis was exported in Excel and PDF formats for easy sharing and documentation.
